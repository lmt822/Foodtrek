# Status Report 2

### What was accomplished
- works on login page
- Using Bootstrap to add styple sheets to most pages
- Built major HTML for the project
- Learned how to use Ruby on Rail (at least one member is good at it)
- Stragety for how the trek works and associated data flow

### Challenges and Issues
- login page authentication
- get time to work on the project when many final projects are comming...

### Future plan
- move everything to Ruby on Rails framework
- find a good login API and integrate it successfully
- Javascript for map
- set up database and server
- Design how the trek works (in steps and command language)
- backend: handle the documents and collection of treks under each user
- front-end: mark onto the map
